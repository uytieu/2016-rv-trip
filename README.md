- Make sure all valves are pushed in and closed before unscrewing tank caps
- Do not bring your own fire wood to location. Buy local.
- Dump tanks before traveling, to reduce weight and save on fuel
- Blue apron made cooking easy while traveling. 
- Cooking in RV is ok with limited space, but cooking outside is best
